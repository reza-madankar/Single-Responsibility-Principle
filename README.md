# he SOLID principles are a set of object-oriented design principles that help developers create more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software. They stand for:

#### S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
#### O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
#### L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
#### I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
#### D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Let's go through an example of each principle in C#.

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have one job or responsibility.

## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification. You should be able to add functionality without changing existing code.

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Furthermore, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
